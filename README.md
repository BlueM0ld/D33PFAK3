# D33PFAK3 ~ Deepfakes!

The purpose of this repo is to understand and record implementations and methods that are used in this technology - I AM NOT AN EXPERT

# What is a deepfake?
A deep fake takes deep learning technologies and uses them to 'fake' and 'simulate' individuals or objects in images or videos that weren't present originally.
GANs or generative adversarial networks are a large component of deepfakes. It is a model that self-improves through 2 main components a generator and a verifier. The generator creates content and the verifier assesses the quality of the content. 

# Issues with Deepfakes?
Deepfakes can be used with ill intent and can create misinformation. It has been used to create false narratives. This is concerning and so there are efforts to realise which videos/images are real or not. 

Following DeepFaceLab's Paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.05535.pdf - there are 3 main phases of the pipeline 

- Extraction
- Training
- Conversion
